A mathematician claims that the average IQ of a group of incoming freshman taking College Algebra is more than 99. To check the claim, a random sample of 23 incoming freshmen is selected and the average IQ for these students is found to be 101. The standard deviation of the
population is known to be 1.35. At a = 0.05, test the mathematician's claim.
Give your answers in the box below to the following questions
a) Write the hypotheses. Label the statements HO or HI. Identify the claim.
b) Does the problem require a z value or at value for the critical value? What is the critical value?
c) Use the formula to calculate the test value. Show the set up for the formula and give your
final answer
d) Answer either "Reject the null" or "Do not reject null"
e) Use the chart provided in the lecture notes to write a concluding statement.
